# Day 3: The "No Fluff" Challenge
**Time Required**: 15 Minutes
**Type**: Editing

---

## 1. The Concept (2 mins)
Filler words ("basically", "actually", "just") weaken your message.
*   **Weak**: "I just basically wanted to check if you actually saw the email."
*   **Strong**: "Did you see the email?"

**Rule for Today**: Cut the fat.

## 2. The Assignment (10 mins)
Take this paragraph and delete every unnecessary word. Keep the meaning, but make it shorter.

**Original**:
"So, basically, I was thinking that maybe we could, you know, try to start the meeting a little bit earlier, like around 10 AM, if that is okay with everyone, because actually I have another call right after."

**Your Edited Version**:

## 3. The Check-in (3 mins)

**DONE. Close this file.**
