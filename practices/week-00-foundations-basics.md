# Week 0: Foundations & Basics
**Focus**: Building a strong vocabulary and constructing clear sentences.

Before we worry about *paragraphs* or *speeches*, we must master the **Word** and the **Sentence**.

---

## Core Concept: Precision
Weak communication uses vague words ("It was a good meeting").
Strong communication uses precise words ("It was a productive meeting").

Your goal this week is to replace "lazy words" with "working words."

---

## Day 1: The Power of Verbs (Action Words)
Verbs drive the sentence. Weak verbs need help from adverbs. Strong verbs stand alone.

### The "Stop Using 'Do/Make/Get'" Challenge

**Weak** -> **Strong**
- "I *did* a plan" -> "I **created** a plan"
- "I *made* a mistake" -> "I **committed** a mistake"
- "I *got* an email" -> "I **received** an email"
- "I *went* to the office" -> "I **commuted** to the office" / "I **arrived** at the office"

### Practice
Rewrite these sentences with stronger verbs:
1. "I said no to his idea." -> (Suggested: I **rejected** / **declined** his idea)
2. "He looked at the report." -> (Suggested: He **examined** / **reviewed** the report)
3. "We talked about the issue." -> (Suggested: We **discussed** / **debated** the issue)

## Day 2: Adjectives - Beyond "Good" and "Bad"
"Good" and "Bad" are the most overused words. They mean nothing because they mean everything.

### The Vocabulary Upgrade

**Instead of "Good":**
- For a person: **Skilled, Capable, Talented**
- For an idea: **Innovative, Practical, Brilliant**
- For food: **Delicious, Flavorful**
- For a situation: **Favorable, Positive**

**Instead of "Bad":**
- For a mistake: **Critical, Serious**
- For quality: **Inferior, Poor**
- For behavior: **Inappropriate, Unacceptable**
- For a situation: **Challenging, Difficult**

### Practice
Describe your day yesterday without using "good", "bad", "nice", or "fine". Write 3 sentences.

---

## Day 3: Removing "Very"
Using "very" is a sign of a weak vocabulary.

**Weak** -> **Strong**
- Very big -> **Massive / Huge / Enormous**
- Very small -> **Tiny / Minimal**
- Very happy -> **Delighted / Thrilled**
- Very sad -> **Devastated / Upset**
- Very important -> **Crucial / Essential / Vital**
- Very interesting -> **Fascinating**

### Practice
Write 5 sentences about your work/studies using the **Strong** words above.

---

## Day 4: Nouns - Specificity
Don't use "Thing" or "Stuff". Name the object or concept.

**Vague** -> **Specific**
- "Hand me that *thing*." -> "Hand me that **document / stapler / remote**."
- "I have a lot of *stuff* to do." -> "I have many **tasks / assignments / errands**."
- "He has a *problem*." -> "He is facing a **dilemma / challenge / obstacle**."

### Practice
Look around your room. Name 5 objects with their specific names (not just "chair", but "ergonomic chair" or "wooden stool").

---

## Day 5: Simple Sentence Structure (S-V-O)
A clear sentence usually follows this order: **Subject + Verb + Object**.

**Confusing**: "With regarding the project, finished it was by me." (Passive/Cluttered)
**Clear**: "I finished the project." (Active/Clear)

**Subject**: Who is doing the action? (I)
**Verb**: What is the action? (finished)
**Object**: What received the action? (the project)

### Practice
Write 10 simple S-V-O sentences about what you do daily.
Example: "I write code." "I drink coffee." "I call my team."

---

## Day 6: Linking Words (The Glue)
Don't just write short sentences. Connect them logically.

- **And**: Adds information (I like tea, **and** I like coffee.)
- **But**: Shows contrast (I like tea, **but** I hate coffee.)
- **Because**: Shows reason (I drink water **because** I am thirsty.)
- **So**: Shows result (I was tired, **so** I went to sleep.)

### Practice
Take two simple sentences and combine them using one of the words above.
1. "It is raining." + "I have an umbrella."
2. "I want to learn." + "I will practice daily."

---

## Day 7: Multilingual Meaning (English/Marathi/Hindi)
Don't translate word-for-word. Translate the *meaning*.

**Concept**: "Respect"
- English: "I respect him."
- Marathi: "Mala tyancha adar ahe." (I have respect for him)
- Hindi: "Main unki izzat karta hoon." (I do his respect)

Notice how the *structure* changes but the *core word* remains the anchor.

### Practice
Pick 3 words. Write a sentence for each in English, Marathi, and Hindi. Focus on using the correct "weight" of the word in each language.
